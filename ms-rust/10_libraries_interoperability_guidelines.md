# Libraries / Interoperability Guidelines



## Don't Leak External Types (M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES) { #M-DONT-LEAK-TYPES }

<why>To prevent accidental breakage and long-term maintenance cost.</why>
<version>0.1</version>

Where possible, you should prefer `std`<sup>1</sup> types in public APIs over types coming from external crates. Exceptions should be carefully considered.

Any type in any public API will become part of that API's contract. Since `std` and constituents are the only crates
shipped by default, and since they come with a permanent stability guarantee, their types are the only ones that come without an interoperability risk.

A crate that exposes another crate's type is said to _leak_ that type.

For maximal long term stability your crate should, theoretically, not leak any types. Practically, some leakage
is unavoidable, sometimes even beneficial. We recommend you follow this heuristic:

- [ ] if you can avoid it, do not leak third-party types
- [ ] if you are part of an umbrella crate,<sup>2</sup> you may freely leak types from sibling crates.
- [ ] behind a relevant feature flag, types may be leaked (e.g., `serde`)
- [ ] without a feature _only_ if they give a _substantial benefit_. Most commonly that is interoperability with significant
      other parts of the Rust ecosystem based around these types.

<sup>1</sup> In rare instances, e.g., high performance libraries used from embedded, you might even want to limit yourself to `core` only.

<sup>2</sup> For example, a `runtime` crate might be the umbrella of `runtime_rt`, `runtime_app` and `runtime_clock` As users are
expected to only interact with the umbrella, siblings may leak each others types.

## Native Escape Hatches (M-ESCAPE-HATCHES) { #M-ESCAPE-HATCHES }

<why>To allow users to work around unsupported use cases until alternatives are available.</why>
<version>0.1</version>

Types wrapping native handles should provide `unsafe` escape hatches. In interop scenarios your users might have gotten a native handle from somewhere
else, or they might have to pass your wrapped handle over FFI. To enable these use cases you should provide `unsafe` conversion methods.

```rust
# type HNATIVE = *const u8;
pub struct Handle(HNATIVE);

impl Handle {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        // Safely creates handle via API calls
        # todo!()
    }

    // Constructs a new Handle from a native handle the user got elsewhere.
    // This method  should then also document all safety requirements that
    // must be fulfilled.
    pub unsafe fn from_native(native: HNATIVE) -> Self {
        Self(native)
    }

    // Various extra methods to permanently or temporarily obtain
    // a native handle.
    pub fn into_native(self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
    pub fn to_native(&self) -> HNATIVE { self.0 }
}
```



## Types are Send (M-TYPES-SEND) { #M-TYPES-SEND }

<why>To enable the use of types in Tokio and behind runtime abstractions</why>
<version>1.0</version>

Public types should be `Send` for compatibility reasons:

- All futures produced (explicitly or implicitly) must be `Send`
- Most other types should be `Send`, but there might be exceptions

### Futures

When declaring a future explicitly you should ensure it is, and remains, `Send`.

```rust
# use std::future::Future;
# use std::pin::Pin;
# use std::task::{Context, Poll};
#
struct Foo {}

impl Future for Foo {
    // Explicit implementation of `Future` for your type
    # type Output = ();
    #
    # fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<<Self as Future>::Output> { todo!() }
}

// You should assert your type is `Send`
const fn assert_send<T: Send>() {}
const _: () = assert_send::<Foo>();
```

When returning futures implicitly through `async` method calls, you should make sure these are `Send` too.
You do not have to test every single method, but you should at least validate your main entry points.

```rust,edition2021
async fn foo() { }

// TODO: We want this as a macro as well
fn assert_send<T: Send>(_: T) {}
_ = assert_send(foo());
```

### Regular Types

Most regular types should be `Send`, as they otherwise infect futures turning them `!Send` if held across `.await` points.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    let rc = Rc::new(123);      // <-- Holding this across an .await point prevents
    read_file("foo.txt").await; //     the future from being `Send`.
    dbg!(rc);
}
```

That said, if the default use of your type is _instantaneous_, and there is no reason for it to be otherwise held across `.await` boundaries, it may be `!Send`.

```rust,edition2021
# use std::rc::Rc;
# struct Telemetry; impl Telemetry { fn ping(&self, _: u32) {} }
# fn telemetry() -> Telemetry  { Telemetry }
# async fn read_file(x: &str) {}
#
async fn foo() {
    // Here a hypothetical instance Telemetry is summoned
    // and used ad-hoc. It may be ok for Telemetry to be !Send.
    telemetry().ping(0);
    read_file("foo.txt").await;
    telemetry().ping(1);
}
```
